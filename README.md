### Lab 1

from Distilleries located at different locations. Acquired data from the Strathclyde University research project. Conducted exploratory analysis of the data set included- analysing taste between whiskies, finding a distillery with that satisfy input flavour characteristics, creating average flavour profile, and creating new flavour categories, and identify new whiskey creation and visualise the same. 
The concepts used is normalisation, interpolation, statistics, eigenvectors, PCA and system of linear equations. Tools used: Pyhton, Numpy and Pandas, matplotlib.


### Lab 2

Implemented task of optimizaiton (random search, hill-climbing and gradient descent from scratch and Optimising the weights in a basic neural network for face pose estimation.Tools used: Pyhton, Numpy and Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.


### Lab 3

Established a probabilistic model based to identify the location of the submarine and visualise the same. Utilised Probability concepts with discrete and random variables; Probability mass and density functions; manipulating marginal, joint, and conditional distributions, Bayeâ€™s rule, and multivariate normal distribution. Tools used: Pyhton, Numpy and Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

### Lab 4

Performed exploratory data analysis on Covertype Data Set from the UCI repository and optimised the data storage in pandas data frame by using PCA and enhanced querying performance and visualised the same. Tools used: Pyhton, Numpy and Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. (Grade Obtained: A1).
